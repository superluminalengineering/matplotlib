seaborn styles renamed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Matplotlib currently ships many style files inspired from the seaborn
library ("seaborn", "seaborn-bright", "seaborn-colorblind", etc.) but they
have gone out of sync with the library itself since the release of seaborn
0.9.  To prevent confusion, the style files have been renamed "seaborn-v0_8",
"seaborn-v0_8-bright", "seaborn-v0_8-colorblind", etc.  Users are encouraged to
directly use seaborn to access the up-to-date styles.
